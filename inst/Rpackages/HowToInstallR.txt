1) Install latest R version (here R-4.0.3-win.exe) --> maybe check for updates
2) Install RStudio
3) Open "install.packages.R" in RStudio
4) mark text in script and press ctrl + enter to run the script
5) the packages should install themselves (you might need to run RStudio as Administrator)

You only need to run "install.packages.R" once. 
The packages can be loaded as required by calling library(package name).
