Title: Analysis of Potentiostat Output for Battery Research
Version: 2.1.1
Author: fabje223
Maintainer: Fabian Jeschull <fabian.jeschull@kit.edu>
Description: This package was developed to facilitate the data processing
    and analysis of experimental battery data from potentiostats.  Each
    potentiostat manufacturer uses his own file formats that are only
    readable in customized software.  Usually an export into .txt, .csv or
    .xlsx files is possible. The structure of each of these files,
    including the way the data is reported, can differ considerably
    between different manufacturer.  This tools aims to convert various
    potentiostat outputs into a uniform structure while extracting key
    parameters and datasets for further graphical processing (e.g. in
    Origin). In addition, a html report can be created that offers an
    option to quickly access certain information. The package is
    deliberately designed in a modular manner, so that other potentiostats
    can be easly integrated into the existing structure.  For this tool to
    work metadata has to be provided.
