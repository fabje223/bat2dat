Title: Analysis of Potentiostat Output for Battery Research
Version: 1.0.1
Author: fabje223
Maintainer: Fabian Jeschull <fabian.jeschull@kit.edu>
Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line) Use four
    Battery Cycling Data Different Potentiostats produce different
    experimental output files.  Some of them are easy readable, as they
    are saves as .txt or .xlsx files, while others need to be exported
    into a readable format prior to further processing.  This tools aims
    to convert various potentiostat outputs into a uniform structure while
    extracting key parameters and datasets for further graphical
    processing (e.g. in Origin).  For this tool to work metadata has to be
    provided.
