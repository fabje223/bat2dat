Title: Analysis of Potentiostat Output for Battery Research
Version: 0.1.0
Maintainer: Fabian Jeschull <fabian.jeschull@kit.edu>
Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line) Use four
    Battery Cycling Data
Different Potentiostats produce different experimental output files.
Some of them are easy readable, as they are saves as .txt or .xlsx files, 
while others need to be exported into a readable format prior to further processing.
This tools aims to convert various potentiostat outputs into a uniform structure
while extracting key parameters and datasets for further graphical processing (e.g. in Origin).
For this tool to work metadata has to be provided.
