# bat2dat

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end --> 

This package was developed to facilitate the data processing and analysis of experimental battery data from potentiostats.
Each potentiostat manufacturer uses his own file formats that are only readable in customized software. 
Usually an export into .txt, .csv or .xlsx files is possible. The structure of each of these files, including the way the data is reported, can differ considerably between different manufacturer.
This tools aims to convert various potentiostat outputs into a uniform structure while extracting key parameters and datasets for further graphical processing (e.g. in Origin). In addition, a html report can be created that offers an option to quickly access certain information. The package is deliberately designed in a modular manner, so that other potentiostats can be easly integrated into the existing structure.
For this tool to work metadata has to be provided. 

  > **NOTE**\
  > The script was derived from standard in-house cycling protocols of full cell and half cell configurations.\
  > Standard tests include repeating rest-charge-rest-discharge cycles. The cycling rate can be different in different cycles.
  > Cycling protocols are frequently very individual experiments to a specific cell configuration and setup.\
  > Although the functions to this package have been written in a general manner and with this challenge in mind,\
  > the results of any processed data should be carefully checked, for example against the data viewer options in the proprietary 
  > software of the respective potentiostat manufacturers.

  To update to the latest version of *bat2dat* repeat step 3) once in a while.

## Requirements

The main idea of bat2dat is to provide an easy way to convert data from battery cyclers into a standardized format for further processing. \
bat2dat requires a curated data folder containing: \
  - experimental data (.txt, .xlsx, ... etc.) --> the format depends on the battery cycler used \
  - a metadata file *'meta.csv'*
  meta.csv requires the following general structure: \
  
  | Identifier | sample.name | instrument | cell.config | AM.loading |
  |:----------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:----------:|
  | Sample 1 | experiment1 | Biologic BCS | halfcell-anode | 1.00 |
  
### **Notes -1-: bat2dat specific *meta.csv* syntax**\
  - in case meta.csv is created manually:
  
  > *Identifier*, *sample.name*, *instrument* and *cell.config* are text or character items and need to be put in quotation marks, e.g. "sample 1"\
  > items in meta.csv are separated by a tab separator\
    
  - *instrument*:

  > *Biologic BCS* refers to BCS instrument by Biologic (.txt format, exported from ECLab) \
  > *Biologic VMP* refers to VMP/VSP instruments by Biologic (.txt format, exported from ECLab) \
  > *Arbin* refers to Arbin battery cyclers (.res format or exported via Excel Plug-In as .xlsx) \
  
  bat2dat has a modular approach and more cyclers can be added if needed.\
  
  - *cell.config* has to be defined for some of the scripts in order to split up charge and discharge sequences correctly:
  
  > *halfcell-anode* (cycling starts with a negative current)\
  > *halfcell-cathode* & *fullcell* (the two are equivalent; cycling starts with a positive current)\
  > *LiS* is an except, as it is cell-specific: sulfur batteries, though a cathode, are techniqually in a charged state and thus start with a negative current.\
  
  - *AM.loading*: the active material mass should be given in units of [mg]

### **Notes -2-: bat2dat specific *meta.csv* syntax**\
  *meta.csv* can be created from digital lab notebooks.\
  A POLiS and Kadi4Mat compatible notebook is provided in the */data-raw folder* (*labnotes_example.xlsx*).\
  The *meta.csv* file can be generated using the ***CellLog-xlsx-to-csv.R*** script.\
  Other notebook imports can be created upon request.
  
```{r}
data(exampleMeta)
knitr::kable(head(exampleMeta, 2), 
             align = 'c',
             caption = "Table: Structure of meta.csv file")
```
  

## Supported datasets
### Biologic Data
Biologic instruments save acquired data in a *.mpr* file (*EC-Lab raw data binary file*), which is complex to read-in directly. Therefore, the workaround herein is to **use export function of EC-Lab** (*Experiment > Export as Text...*).  

```{r, fig.caption=paste("Exporting .mpr files from EC-Lab as .txt files"), echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-BiologicTXTExport.png")
```

The exported data table should look like this (may vary depending on the exported variables):
```{r}
data(exampleData)
knitr::kable(head(exampleData, 5), 
             align = 'c',
             caption = "Table: Structure of EC-Lab .txt files")
```

  The strange looking column names are a result of the import into R and are renamed during the analysis. For the script to work, ***the following parameters need to be exported***:
  
  > cycle.number, time.s, Ns, Ecell.V, X.I..mA, Q.discharge.mA.h, Q.charge.mA.h
  
  **Note**: Biologic BCS name the potential *Ecell.V*, whereas VMP/VSP/MPG potentiostats call the same parameter *Ewe.V*. This is an important distinction and the reason why *Biologic BCS* is a separate "instrument parameter" in the *meta.csv* file.

### Arbin Data
Arbin data comes in 2 formats: it is saved by the instrument as a *.res* file and can be converted via the Excel plug-in to a *.xlsx* result file with several tabs for metadata. raw cycling data, (processed) Stats-Tab for end-of-cycling-sequence information (e.g. cycle number vs. capacity).\
The script uses *.xlsx* files for data processing (note that a "stat" tab, containing the end-of-cycle charge and discharge capacities, can be obtained using the Arbin excel macro).\
The package contains functions for the Import of *.res* files, using the RODBC package (included in the package recommendations above). In this case the file extension is changed in the process from .res to *.accdb* (Access database file). However, this part has caused problems repeatedly.


## How to use

**Experimental data and the metadata file need to be located in the same folder on the local hard drive.**\
The analysis script is started by executing:

```
#if library is not loaded already
library(bat2dat)

# generates a data report if htmlReport == TRUE
# exports a .txt file if exportCap == TRUE
report0r(   cccv = FALSE,                 #optional
            cycles = c(1,2,5,10,25,50),   #optional
            htmlReport = TRUE, 
            exportCap = TRUE)
```

During execution you will be asked for the directory of your experimental data. Select the meta.csv file and execution will continue. **It is important that meta.csv and raw data files are located in the same folder**. Additional files do not interfere.

> the script offers four options:\
> - perform a CC-CV step analysis to separate constant current and constant potential contributions? yes(=TRUE)/no(=FALSE)\
> - which cycles would you like to extract to plot voltage profiles?\
>   options:  - use default (c(seq(0, 100, 10)), i.e. 0, 10, 20, 30,..., 100) Note that Biologic starts counting from 0. \
>             - make your own selection, type: c(*cycle#x*, *cycle#y*, ..., *cycle#xy*) or for a number range, e.g. c(1:100)\
> - generate a html-report? yes(=TRUE)/no(=FALSE)\
> - export analysed data as .txt file? yes(=TRUE)/no(=FALSE)\
>
> The default settings for the latter two is TRUE. The script won't run the analysis if both values are set to FALSE (at least one has to be TRUE).\
> once the script started, you will be asked to specify the location of your data.\
> see also: Section Examples


If you'd like to work with your data in R afterwards, call report0r() like this:\

```
samples <- report0r( htmlReport = TRUE, 
                     exportCap = TRUE)
```

samples will be a list of all samples contained in the metadata file (*meta.csv*) and contains up to three different analysed objects:

  > *capacity*: end of cycling squence (e.g. charge & discharge capacity or Coulombic efficiency vs. cycle number) --> format: R data.frame\
  > *VoltageProfiles*: section of raw data for selected cycles --> format: list of data.frames\
  > *CCCV*: if galvanostatic cycling was performed in a constant current constant potential technqiue (CC-CV), a CCCV step analysis can be performed, splitting the contributions of the CC and CV step --> format: R data.frame\

Exported data will be saved as a subfolder *Rprocessed* of the raw data folder (*path/to/data/Rprocessed*) on your local hard drive. 

## Functions

### report0r()
> Full analysis with .txt export and html report\
All initial parameters of the report0r function have a default value, so that the script can be run with default settings, like so:

```
#if library is not loaded already
library(bat2dat)

# generates a data report if htmlReport == TRUE
# exports a .txt file if exportCap == TRUE
report0r()
```

If you would like to change the cycles for the voltage profile extraction run *report0r()* like this: 

In this first example  html report *and* .txt export will both be executed):
```
#if library is not loaded already
library(bat2dat)

# generates a data report if htmlReport == TRUE
# exports a .txt file if exportCap == TRUE
report0r(cycles = c(1,2,5,10,25,50))
```
In the second example only the .txt export is performed (same cycles are extracted), i.e. put the function to FALSE you do not want included:
```
#if library is not loaded already
library(bat2dat)

# generates a data report if htmlReport == TRUE
# exports a .txt file if exportCap == TRUE
report0r( cycles = c(1,2,5,10,25,50), 
          htmlReport = FALSE)
```

> **HINT**
> There are different ways to choose your cycles:\
>   - manually: cycles = c(1,6,9,3,12,99) --> no specific order needed, just type the numbers you'd like to extract\
>   - intervall: cycles = c(seq(0, 99, 10)) --> the first two numbers define the boundary (from 0 to 99); the third number defines the interval (every 10th cycle)\
>   - mixed: cycles = c(0,1,2,4, seq(9,99,10)) --> combine the two above.

### process0r() 

> perform a data analysis and receive sample information in a R list object for further processing\

If you'd like to skip the export and report function all together call process0r() directly (before report0r() did this job for us):\

```
# if library is not loaded already
library(bat2dat)

# starts data analysis
# default: cccv=FALSE & cycles(seq(0,100,10))
expList <- process0r()
```

To further work the results of the analysis, the results need to be saved in a R-list ('a generic vector containing other objects'; <http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/list>). A specific experiment (cell i) can be extracted as follows:

```
# export separate experiments into individual R-lists (here cell1)
cell1 <- expList[[i]]

# Access processed data
capacity <- cell1$capacity                # or expList[[i]]$capacity
voltageprofiles <- cell1$VoltageProfiles  # voltageprofiles is a R-list with containing data.frame() of all cycles defined in *cycles*

# export a single voltage profile
VP1 <- voltageprofiles[[1]]
VP1 <- cell1$VoltageProfiles[[1]]
VP1 <- expList[[1]]$VoltageProfiles[[1]]

```

If you would like to make changes to the analysis, i.e. include a CC-CV step analysis (cccv=TRUE) or change the cycle numbers in the voltage profile extraction proceed like this:\

```
# if library is not loaded already
library(bat2dat)

# starts data analysis
# default: cccv=FALSE & cycles(seq(0,100,10))
expList <- process0r( cccv=TRUE,
                      cycles(1,2,5,10,25))
```

### reportGenerat0r()

> generates RMarkdown (html) sample report of a **single** experiment

*process0r()* stores all processed data provided *meta.csv* in a list. A single element of that list, i.e. a single experiment, can be exported into a separate object and then passed to *reportGenerat0r()* for processing.
This allows you to check your data before generating a html report. Of course, it is also possible to add different analysis steps between the basic data imports and generating standard outfiles used in battery research.

A call or reportGenerat0r() could look like this:\

```
# import and analyse your data with process0r()
l <- process0r()

# select a single experiment
# you can check the elements in l in RStudios by clicking on it in the Environment tab or check the number of elements in l with length(l)
exp <- l[[i]]

# initiate the generation of your report
reportGenerat0r(exp)
```


### metaDir()

> import a meta data file from a folder

To import a meta data table into R simple use:\

```
#if library is not loaded already
library(bat2dat)

# starts data analysis
meta <- metaDir()
```

### BCSraw(), VMPraw(), ARBINrawXLSX()

> import raw data files into R

The functions require 2 variables:\
  - *directory* (dir), i.e. where is the file stored
  - *filename*, name of the experimental data file (for BCSraw and VMPraw a .txt file; for ARBINrawXLSX a .xlsx file)\
  
  The two variables need to be either be defined prior, or be available in a metadata file (--> metaDir())\
  
```
#if library is not loaded already
library(bat2dat)

# starts data analysis
raw <- VMPraw(dir, filename)
```

If a metadata file was imported through metaDir(), use:\
```
raw <- VMPraw(dir=meta$dir[1], 
              filename= meta$sample.name[1])
```
*Note: the number in brackets [x] is the entry in the metadata file (by row)*\

You could also type *filename* (without file extension, i.e. .txt, etc) and *dir* manually. Or using the following code snippet:\
```
#Pop-up window to select file path:
fileDir <- file.choose()

#defines dir
dir <- dirname(fileDir)
```

## (De)Bugs

During installation of the package the following error message occured repeatedly:

```
Loading required package: ggplot2
Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘ggplot2’ in loadNamespace(i, c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]):
namespace ‘rlang’ 1.0.2 is already loaded, but >= 1.0.6 is required
Error: package ‘ggplot2’ could not be loaded
```

Update to a newer version of 'rlang' package
```
# update rlang
install.packages('rlang')  
```
